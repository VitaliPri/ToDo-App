"ToDo-App" is a web application built using React, Vite, the latest version of React Router 6.4, TailwindCSS, and REST API. The purpose of the application is to create and manage a list of tasks or to-dos.
To explore the full functionality and features of the ToDo-App, you can clone or download the repository and open the files in a web browser to see the application in action.
You'll need to follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or download the repository as a ZIP file and extract its contents.
2. Open the extracted folder, which contains the ToDo-App project files in VSCode
3. The ToDo-App has a backend, so it is not a static web application, so you need to run the server by executing the following commands:
   npm install json-server && json-server --watch db.json
   It will start the server in the following ports:
   http://localhost:3000/data
   http://localhost:3000
4. Then you need to open another terminal in order to start the application.
5. Make sure that you are in the same folder and run the following commands:
   npm i && npm run dev
   then click on a local web server running on your own machine something like this http://localhost:5173/
   This will open the application in your default web browser, launching the ToDo-App.
6. Interact with the ToDo-App by adding, deleting, or updating tasks using the provided interface.
7. Enjoy!
